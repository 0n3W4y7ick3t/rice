# Leon's Linux Rice
I use [gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) + [dwm](https://github.com/0n3W4y7ick3t/dwm), but this should works on any other linux distros with little tweaks(eg. some pkgs' names maybe different).
- This repo is heavily inspired by Luke Smith's [voidrice](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice), I use lots of his scripts too.
