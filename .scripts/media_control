# media_control - A script to control media playback for MPC and Playerctl
# It toggles/next/prev current playing source or last played source
# The last played source is managed in /tmp/last_played
#
# Usage:
#   ./media_control                  # Print currently playing media or last played one
#   ./media_control toggle           # Toggle play/pause
#   ./media_control next             # Play the next track
#   ./media_control prev             # Play the previous track
