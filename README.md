# Leon Satoshi's Linux Rice
Used by my artix and gentoo(I use [dwm](https://github.com/0n3W4y7ick3t/dwm)), should works on any other linux distros with little tweaks(eg. some pkgs' name maybe different).
- This repo is heavily inspired by Luke Smith's [voidrice](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice), I use lots of his scripts too.

## Glitters

## Hints
- you may need to compile picom from source(or install picom-git in AUR) if the one you get from offical repos does not have glx backend support(in gentoo, just enable opengl USE flag and emerge picom)
